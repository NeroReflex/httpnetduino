# httpnetduino
An HTTP web server written for Netduino Plus 2. May also work on Plus 1, but it is not tested.
This web server was written starting from the ground up, using Visual Studio 2013 and .NET micro framework 4.5.

This web server can also give a JSON respose if some particular URL are hit with a GET request.
